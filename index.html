        Lastly, given the recent surge in infected cases, please stay home and order in your meals. Pagla Barbuchi is available on Pathao Food and Efood.</p>

         <h2>Special Cake</h2>
         <p>Cake is a form of sweet food made from flour, sugar, and other ingredients, that is usually baked. In their oldest forms, cakes were modifications of bread, but cakes now cover a wide range of preparations that can be simple or elaborate, and that share features with other desserts such as pastries, meringues, custards, and pies.</p>

If you’re new to the magical powers of yogurt marinades, this baked Greek Chicken is going to convert you for life!</p>
